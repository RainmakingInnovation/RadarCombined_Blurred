Erosion, loss of nutrients and biodiversity, acidification, pollution and salinization... Every year, between 25 and 40 billion metric tons of the planet’s ""epidermis"" disappear. Plots of land become sterile, unusable for agriculture. Transforming these inert soils into fertile soils is the idea of the Swiss start-up Edaphos. How? Through a process of biological engineering, based on the properties of the mycelium, the vegetative part of mushrooms. It makes it possible to transform construction waste (rubble, plaster, etc.) into fertile soil for agriculture, horticulture or viticulture by accelerating the soil renewal process. Building site waste is recycled directly on construction sites and can be used to meet the various needs for soil: brownfield rehabilitation, eroded agricultural soils, parks and urban gardens.
